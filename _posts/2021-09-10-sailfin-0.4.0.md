**Version 0.4.0** has been released to [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/ahappyhuman/sailfin)! As for the new features, the biggest one is the new but still basic music player. To support the music player, a whole lot of code had to be written on the C++ side of things, is also the reason why this release took a long time. The upside of this is that it had to be done no matter what to support some of the more upcoming features I have in mind, such as downloading parts of the library of your device.

Additionally, Sailfin will now try to play video’s without transcoding first. Only if it seems it notices that certain codecs are not supported, the bitrate exceeds the maximum or if multiple audio streams are present , it will ask the server to transcode. Transcoding can also be entirely disabled for if the server runs on a Raspberry Pi or a similar device that cannot handle transcoding that well.

Furthermore, some miscellaneous UI tweaks have been made to the application and I’ve also compiled an aarch64 version for the Xperia 10 II.

I’ve tried my best to make sure that there are no regressions compared to the previous version, but since the C++ side was completely rewritten I expect that there still might be some that I haven´t found. Please let me know if you find any of them.
