**Sailfin 0.3.0** has been released on [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/ahappyhuman/sailfin)!

## Changelog:

### Playback
 * New: playback progress is reported to the Jellyfin server.
 * New: resume partly played items or start playing from the beginning if desired.

### UI
 * Added: if an image cannot be loaded, it will have a random background colour.
 * Improved: Added video fallback page to allow unknown video types to be played, although without extra metadata.
 * Improved: Added folder fallback page, so unknown collection types are at least displayed without metadata.
 * Improved: icon now looks more like a Sailfin fish

### Collections
 * Added: allow specifying sort order (Ascending, Descending)

## Known issues:
 * The RPM is larger than it should be, due to a library not getting stripped.
 * Sometimes changing the sort order breaks things
